This repo contains utilities to download the current list of active weather
stations in Canada.

Currently, this downloads information about the Environment Canada weather
stations and produces a CSV file with their details including
* Lat and Long
* Various IDs used to identify the station
* The station name
* A link to the historical records for this station

I wrote this utility to produce CSV files for use with Google's "My Maps" 
feature.

Why would I need a map of weather stations in Canada? 
I do lots of wilderness travel. I sometime like to analyze recent weather data
for locations will travel to in order to pack more efficiently and do better
route planning. This is especially useful in the winter where I try to
anticipate lake ice and snow conditions.

I find the way Environment Canada shows information about weather stations
painful to use when trying to find the best station to draw data from. By
overlaying the active stations on a map I can more easily determine the best
choice. The helpful url then makes it easy to jump to the data.

Below is a list of maps I have created using output from this script
